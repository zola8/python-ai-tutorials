# Run MongoDB with Docker

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-community-with-docker/

#### 1. Pull the MongoDB Docker Image

Use the latest... but as I have an old one, I use that.

```shell
docker pull mongo:4.2.13
```

#### 2. Install python dependencies

```shell
pip install pymongo
```
