challenge:
    - propagate identity
    - what the user can do
    - bad actor who impersonates you
    - how do we trust identity?
    - how do we accept transitive trust? (remote agent trust on my agent...)




delegation patterns:
    - no delegation
            user <---> application <---> database

    - trusted assertion: who is the user?
            user <--->      identity provider <---> application     <---> database
            user has privilege

    - simple delegation
            get a token

            user <---> chatbot <---> router <---> another agent
                     + identity provider

    - on behalf of delegation

    - multiple IDPs (identity providers)

        ( company A agents )   <--->   ( company B agents )
        separate IDPs are used in each company


strategies:
    - Oauth2 , OIDC (OpenID Connect) as standard
    - introduce a concept for token exchange
    - leverage: context, scope, audience
    - connect our agents through APIs
    - monitoring
