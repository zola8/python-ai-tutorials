ReAct framework:
    - reason + act upon
    - popular framework to build AI agents
    - iterative process of using LLMs to find answers to question

    1. question from user
    2. thought block
            - analyze the question, decides the steps to execute
            - output: list of steps or actions to execute
    3. action block
            - identify steps, execute them (AI agent executes tool calling) and obtain output
    4. observation block
            - validate if the result answers the user question
            - if more thinking needs --> 2. thought block
            - final answer to the user



Node:
    - a node is a place where logic is executed
    - types:
        - LLM node: analyze prompts, create action, review observation
        - tool: execute tools
        - action: invoke another agent
        - logic: custom logic
    - edge: connect nodes, passes control between nodes
    - conditional edge: helps route requests based on conditional checks


Multi agent systems:
    - individual agents specialize in a specific task or domain
    - agents collaborate and coordinate with each other to achieve the goal
    - mimics how a team of humans collaborates on a given task
    - enables separation-of-concerns and distributed design
    - reusable building blocks (in-house, open source, third party)
    - helps to build complex workflows

routing agent:
    - based on the incoming query, route the request to the appropriate agent
    - classifying
    - one way routing
