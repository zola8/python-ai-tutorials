long run agents (tools, etc...) can cause context failures:
    - context poisoning:    when a hallucination makes it into the context
    - context distraction:  when the context overwhelms the training (eláraszt, túltelít)
    - context confusion:    when superfluous context influences the response
    - context clash:        when parts of the context disagree

approaches:
    - write context (save outside the context window)
    - select context (pulling it into the context window)
    - compressing context (retain the tokens required to perform the task)
    - isolating context (splitting up)
