fine-tuning model:
    - taking a pre-trained model and teaching it to be better at your specific task
    - example: hire a chef and training him on your recipes - not to hire someone and teach cooking from scratch completely
    - feed examples on your specific use cases

when:
    - you need consistent format or style that prompt alone cannot achieve
    - you have a lot of specific domain data the model just hasn't seen before
    - reduce cost by using a smaller, specialized model instead of a massive, larger one

1. gather correct data
